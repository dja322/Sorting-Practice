# Sorting-Practice
This is a repository for testing out various things related to sorting.
How long sorting can take, and which types of arrays are easiest for certain types of sorting algorithms.

It first runs a check on if the sorting algorithms are functional and sorting correctly.
Then it outputs the times it takes for the sorts to run and a percentage on how "unsorted" they are
the higher the number the more unsorted.

Outputs average times to sort and sortedness of array for each sorting method.
Explanation for each sorting method I made is in the .c file for that algorithm

# How to use C sorting algorithms
Run make -mf algorithms_mf then run *sort.exe* 

# How to run python sorting algorithms
However you run python files
